Significant changes to svnwrap (newest changes first).

Version 0.7.0
=============

- Add "pge" and "pgi" shortcuts to propget svn:externals and svn:ignores.

- Support svn v1.7+ svn:externals diff format.

  Newer svn clients now provide line-by-line diff output for changes to
  svn:externals, so svnwrap now detects this case to prevent erroneous
  formatting.

- Port to run on both Python 2.x and 3.x, with 2.6 as the minimum supported
  version of Python.

- Format for PEP8 compliance.
